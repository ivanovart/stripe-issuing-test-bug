It is a single route HTTP server written using Fast-API and Stripe SDK.

1. Put your configs to `.env` (wh secret and stripe api key)
1. To run installing all required packages locally execute: `pipenv install` and `pipenv run uvicorn app.main:app`
1. To run using docker execute `docker build -t stripe-bug .` and `docker run -p "8000:8000" --env-file=.env --rm stripe-bug`
1. Subscribe to webhook using CLI `stripe listen --forward-to=http://localhost:8000/stripe --events issuing_authorization.request`

# How to reproduce
